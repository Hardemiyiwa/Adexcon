                        <p class="fs-5">A reverse osmosis (RO) system is a type of water filtration system that uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove impurities and contaminants from water. It is an effective method for removing dissolved solids, such as salts, minerals, and other contaminants that may be present in tap water. <br><br>RO works by applying pressure to water molecules, forcing them through a semi-permeable membrane that allows only pure water molecules to pass through. The membrane is designed to allow only water molecules to pass through, while blocking other impurities and contaminants. <br> <br>The RO system typically consists of several components, including a pre-filter, a reverse osmosis membrane, a post-filter, and a storage tank. The pre-filter removes larger particles and sediment from the water, while the RO membrane removes dissolved solids and other contaminants. The post-filter then removes any remaining impurities and enhances the taste of the water. <br><br>As the water passes through the membrane, it is separated into two streams - purified water that passes through the membrane and is collected in the storage tank, and wastewater that contains the contaminants and is flushed away. <br><br>Overall, reverse osmosis systems are highly effective at removing contaminants from water and producing clean, pure drinking water. However, they can be more expensive than other types of water filtration systems and may require regular maintenance, including membrane replacement and sanitization.</p>
